### Upgrade Path

This is the initial release, so there are no upgrade considerations. For future releases, we will provide detailed upgrade guides to maintain backward compatibility where possible.

### Known Issues

- Pygame visualization may not work in headless environments (use `visualization_mode='none'`)
- Large grids (>20x20) may require increased memory allocation
- Training on GPU requires CUDA-compatible PyTorch installation

### Roadmap

Future versions will include:
- Additional RL algorithms (PPO, SAC, DQN)
- Multi-agent tracking scenarios
- Advanced sensor models (partial observability, noise)
- Web-based visualization dashboard
- Distributed evaluation framework
